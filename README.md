### FEWD assignment 1
### My name is  *Elizabeth.*

*I am learning to futher use bootstrap, html, css, and javascript. I enjoy learning about communication, and particularily web design.*

In SDCCD's Front End Web Development class I have worked with others to create a functioning website.


We created a website through using UX:
* We used a card-sort
* A reverse card-sort
* And a user profile


I appreciate learning how to store files on the internet.


I also know how to use Adobe Cloud products including:
* Photoshop
* Adobe Illustrator
* InDesign


In reviewing skills, I find W3 Schools extrodinarily helpful, see link: [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com). In contains great links to understanding and learning specific techniques. I also am eager to learn new resources. One that I found recently is [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org ). I enjoy checking out books and material from the library.


In my spare time I like to spend time in nature and outdoors. One of my favorite botanical species is the magnolia tree. I find the small ones that bloom in the spring fabulous. Nature can also be a great source for inspiration for design.
